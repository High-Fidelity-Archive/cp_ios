Helpers
=======

GRMustache helpers allow you to implement "Mustache lambdas", that is to say have your own code executed when GRMustache renders a section such as `{{#name}}...{{/name}}`.

## Overview

When GRMustache renders a section `{{#name}}...{{/name}}`, it looks for the `name` key in the [context stack](context_stack.md), using the standard Key-Value Coding `valueForKey:` method. GRMustache may find a string, an [array](loops.md), a [boolean](booleans.md), whatever, or a helper. It's here a matter of attaching code, instead of regular values, to the keys of your data objects.

GRMustache recognizes a helper when it finds an object that conforms to the `GRMustacheHelper` protocol.

## Helpers in action: implementing a localizing helper

For the purpose of demonstration, we'll implement a helper that translates, via `NSLocalizedString`, the content of the section.

For instance, let's focus on the following template snippet:

    {{#cart}}
      {{#items}}
        {{quantity}} × {{name}}
        {{#localize}}Delete{{/localize}}
      {{/items}}
    {{/cart}}

One will expect `{{#localize}}Delete{{/localize}}` to output `Effacer` when the locale is French.

### Declaring our localizing helper

We need an object that conforms to the `GRMustacheHelper` protocol, so we'll declare a new class.

```objc
@interface LocalizedStringHelper: NSObject<GRMustacheHelper>
@end

@implementation LocalizedStringHelper
- (NSString *)renderSection:(GRMustacheSection *)section withContext:(id)context
{
    return ...;
}
@end
```

That `renderSection:withContext:` method will be invoked when GRMustache renders the sections attached to our helper. It returns the raw string that should be rendered.

#### The literal inner content

Now up to the first implementation. The _section_ argument is a `GRMustacheSection` object, which represents the section being rendered: `{{#localize}}Delete{{/localize}}`.

This _section_ object has a `templateString` property, which returns the literal inner content of the section. It will return `@"Delete"` in our specific example. This looks like a perfect argument for `NSLocalizedString`:

```objc
@implementation LocalizedStringHelper
- (NSString *)renderSection:(GRMustacheSection *)section withContext:(id)context
{
    return NSLocalizedString(section.templateString, nil);
}
@end
```

So far, so good, this would work as expected.

#### Rendering the inner content

Yet the application keeps on evolving, and it appears that the item names should also be localized. The template snippet now reads:

    {{#cart}}
      {{#items}}
        {{quantity}} × {{#localize}}{{name}}{{/localize}}  <-- OMG
        {{#localize}}Delete{{/localize}}
      {{/items}}
    {{/cart}}

Now the strings we have to localize may be:

- literal strings from the template: `Delete`
- strings coming from cart items : `{{name}}`

Our first implementation will fail, since it will return `NSLocalizedString(@"{{name}}", nil)` when localizing item names.

Actually we now need to feed `NSLocalizedString` with the _rendering_ of the inner content, not the _literal_ inner content.

Fortunately, we have:

- the `renderObject:` method of `GRMustacheSection`, which renders the content of the receiver with the provided object. 
- the _context_ parameter, which represents the current rendering context stack.

`[section renderObject:context]` is exactly what we need: the inner content rendered in the current context.

Now we can fix our implementation:

```objc
@implementation LocalizedStringHelper
- (NSString *)renderSection:(GRMustacheSection *)section withContext:(id)context
{
    NSString *renderedContent = [section renderObject:context];
    return NSLocalizedString(renderedContent, nil);
}
@end
```

#### Attaching the helper to the `localize` key

Now we have to have GRMustache find our helper when rendering the `{{#localize}}` sections.

We could have one of our model objects implement a `localize` property. But this feature is not really tied to any of them. Instead, we'll provide our helper aside, thanks to the `renderObjects:` (with an s) method.

```objc
// Prepare data
id data = ...;

// Prepare helper
LocalizedStringHelper *localizeHelper = [[[LocalizedStringHelper alloc] init] autorelease];
NSDictionary *helpers = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:localizeHelper forKey:@"localize"];

// Render
GRMustacheTemplate *template = [GRMustacheTemplate templateFrom...];
NSString *rendering = [template renderObjects:helpers, data, nil];
```

`renderObjects:` is documented in [Guides/templates.md](../templates.md).


### Implementing helpers with blocks

Starting iOS4 and MacOS 10.6, the Objective-C language provides us with blocks. This can relieve the burden of declaring a full class for each helper:

```objc
// Prepare data
id data = ...;

// Prepare helper (no need for a specific class)
GRMustacheBlockHelper *localizeHelper = [GRMustacheBlockHelper helperWithBlock:^(GRMustacheSection *section, id context) {
    NSString *renderedContent = [section renderObject:context];
    return NSLocalizedString(renderedContent, nil);
}];
NSDictionary *helpers = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:localizeHelper forKey:@"localize"];

// Render
GRMustacheTemplate *template = [GRMustacheTemplate templateFrom...];
NSString *rendering = [template renderObjects:helpers, data, nil];
```

## GRMustache helpers vs. Mustache lambdas

**Warning: If your goal is to design GRMustache helpers that remain compatible with Mustache lambdas of [other Mustache implementations](https://github.com/defunkt/mustache/wiki/Other-Mustache-implementations), read the following with great care.**

GRMustache helpers are by far more expressive than required by the Mustache lambda specification.

Especially, the specification [states](https://github.com/mustache/spec/blob/v1.1.2/specs/~lambdas.yml#L27) that lambdas return a *template string* that is automatically rendered (read, processed as a Mustache template, and rendered in the current context).

No problem: GRMustache allows you to comply with the genuine Mustache behavior:

```objc
@implementation BoldHelper
- (NSString *)renderSection:(GRMustacheSection *)section withContext:(id)context
{
    // build the genuine Mustache lambda template string...
    NSString *templateString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"<b>%@</b>", section.templateString];
    
    // ...and render it, as genuine Mustache would:
    return [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:context fromString:templateString error:NULL];
}
@end
```

You can still safely call `[section renderObject:context]`, and include the rendered inner content in your final lambda template string. This is not explicitely stated by the specification, but this possibility is evoked in the "Lambdas" section of http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html, and at https://github.com/mustache/spec/issues/19.

However, beware! `[section renderObject:context]` could return a string that contains unexpected mustache tags `{{junk}}`, that would be processed, and rendered as whatever junk would be found.

Also, should you change the Mustache tag delimiters with a `{{=[ ]=}}` tag, be warned that the specification explicitely [states](https://github.com/mustache/spec/blob/v1.1.2/specs/~lambdas.yml#L40) that lambda strings should be rendered with the default delimiters. This prevents you from rendering a template such as `{{=[ ]=}}[#bold]Welcome, [name].[/bold]`, since `[name]` would not be interpolated.
